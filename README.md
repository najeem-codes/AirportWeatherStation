**Development Process**

_Initial Setup_

Environment: Python 3.x and Flask were chosen as the primary technologies due to their simplicity and effectiveness in creating small to medium-sized web applications.

Project Structure: The application was structured with a main Python script (app.py) to handle routing and logic, and HTML templates for the frontend.

**API Integration**

Weather API: OpenWeatherMap's API was selected for fetching weather data. This choice was motivated by the API's extensive documentation and ease of use.

Requests Library: The Python requests library facilitated communication with the OpenWeatherMap API. This library simplified the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses.

**User Interface**

Bootstrap: To expedite the development of a user-friendly interface, Bootstrap was utilized for styling the application.

Templates: Flask's templating engine, Jinja2, was used to dynamically generate HTML pages. This allowed for real-time updates of weather information based on user input.

**Challenges and Solutions**

_Challenge 1: API Rate Limiting_

Problem: Encountered issues with the OpenWeatherMap API's rate limiting, which restricted the number of requests that could be made within a given timeframe.

Solution: Implemented caching of requests to reduce the number of API calls. This involved storing the results of queries temporarily and serving these stored results when the same request was made within a short period.

_Challenge 2: Handling Invalid Airport Codes_

Problem: The application initially crashed or displayed incorrect information when users entered invalid airport codes.

Solution: Added validation checks before making API requests. If an entered code was found to be invalid, the user would be prompted to correct their input. Additionally, implemented error handling to gracefully manage responses for non-existent locations from the API.

_Challenge 3: User Interface Responsiveness_

Problem: The initial design did not adapt well to different screen sizes, affecting usability on mobile devices.

Solution: Leveraged Bootstrap's grid system and responsive design features to improve the layout and ensure that the application was accessible and functional across a variety of devices.

**Conclusion**

The development of the Airport Weather Station application provided a practical opportunity to explore web development with Flask and external API integration. Through this project, I encountered and overcame several challenges, learning valuable lessons in web application development, API usage, and user interface design. This documentation reflects the journey and insights gained throughout the process, serving as a resource for future development and enhancements.
